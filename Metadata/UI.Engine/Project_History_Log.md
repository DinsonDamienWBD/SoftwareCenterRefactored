# Project: SoftwareCenter.UI.Engine - History Log

## Version 1.0.0 (Initial Planning)

*   **Date:** 2025-12-04
*   **Change:** Initial project architecture and implementation plan defined.
*   **Details:**
    *   Established the `UI.Engine` as a mandatory, core "UI-Kernel" for the application.
    *   Decided on a backend-driven UI approach using SignalR for real-time communication.
    *   Outlined a 5-phase implementation plan, starting with core contracts and culminating in a client-side rendering engine.
    *   Defined the project's structure, key components (`UiCompositionService`, `UiHub`), and its relationship with the `Host`, `Kernel`, and other modules.
