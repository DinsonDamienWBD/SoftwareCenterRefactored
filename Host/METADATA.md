# Project: SoftwareCenter.Host

## Purpose
`SoftwareCenter.Host` is the main executable for the application. It configures and runs the Kestrel web server, initializes the `Kernel` and `UIManager`, and provides the default, baseline implementation for all required application services.

## Key Responsibilities
- **Application Entry Point:** Contains the `Program.main` method that starts the entire application.
- **Web Server Configuration:** Sets up and runs the ASP.NET Core Kestrel server.
- **System Initialization:** Is responsible for adding the `Kernel` and `UIManager` to the service collection and triggering the module loading process.
- **Default Service Provider:** Implements and registers basic, "good enough" versions of core services:
    - **Logging:** A simple logger that writes to a local text file.
    - **Installation:** A handler that executes the default OS action for a file (e.g., double-clicking an `.msi`).
    - **Repository:** A service that can list applications from a local folder.
- **Base UI Layout:** Sends the initial commands to the `UIManager` to construct the main application window, navigation, and content areas.

## Architectural Principles
- **Standalone Application:** The Host can run and provide core functionality without any modules present.
- **No Module References:** The Host has no compile-time knowledge of any specific module.
- **No Core Reference:** The Host does not reference `SoftwareCenter.Core` directly. It interacts with the system via the concrete `Kernel` and `UIManager` projects, which abstracts away the core contracts. This enforces a clean architectural boundary.
- **Extensible:** Its default service registrations can be overridden by modules that register themselves with a higher priority in the Kernel.

## UI Architecture & Flow (As of 2025-12-09)

### Core Concepts
The UI is a composite Single Page Application (SPA) built dynamically from UI fragments. The **`Host`** is the "SOMEBODY" that provides the static base UI framework (the shell `index.html`, main CSS, and main JS). The **`UIManager`** is the "SOMEBODY" that acts as the central service layer or "backend for the frontend," orchestrating the entire UI state and all dynamic modifications. Modules and the Host **do not** manipulate the UI directly; they send commands to the `UIManager` to request UI changes. All UI is provided by the Host and modules as raw HTML, CSS, and JS files, allowing for dynamic updates without recompilation.

### UI Composition and Flow
1.  **`Host` as Framework Provider**:
    *   The `Host` serves the main `index.html` which defines the core layout zones (e.g., Titlebar, Nav area, Content Container, Notification Flyout).
    *   It also provides the global `style.css` for the overall theme and a `script.js` for base interactions and to act as the client-side renderer for `UIManager` events.

2.  **`UIManager` as Orchestrator**:
    *   The `UIManager` exposes a command-based API for all UI manipulations. It maintains an internal state tree of all UI elements, their properties, ownership, and permissions.
    *   It receives requests from the `Host` and `Modules` to create, update, or delete UI elements.

3.  **Dynamic UI Registration**:
    *   **Host & Modules** register their UI fragments by sending commands to the `UIManager`. For example, `RegisterNavButtonCommand` or `RegisterContentContainerCommand`.
    *   The `UIManager` processes these requests, generates unique IDs for each element, and returns them to the requestor.
    *   **Priority & Overrides**: Modules can register UI with a higher priority. For example, a `SourceManager` module can override the default `Host`-provided source management UI. When the module is unloaded, the `UIManager` automatically reverts to the `Host`'s UI.

4.  **Container & Element Injection**:
    *   The `UIManager` provides templates for common UI structures, such as a "card" container.
    *   A module can request a card, receive its ID, and then send further commands to inject specific controls (text inputs, buttons, etc.) into that card. The `UIManager` ensures these elements are injected in a consistent order (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

5.  **Ownership and Permissions**:
    *   The requestor of a UI element is its default **Owner**.
    *   Owners have full control and are responsible for handling interactions for their elements.
    *   Ownership and permissions (read/write/delete) can be partially or fully shared with other modules via specific commands, enabling collaborative UI scenarios.

6.  **Real-time Frontend Sync (via `Host`)**:
    *   After processing a UI command, the `UIManager` does not render HTML. Instead, it publishes an event (e.g., via a SignalR Hub in the `Host`) detailing the state change (e.g., `ElementAdded`, `AttributeUpdated`).
    *   The `Host`'s main `script.js` listens for these events and performs the necessary live DOM manipulations to reflect the new state, making the `UIManager` the single source of truth.

7.  **Module-Specific SPAs (Pop-out functionality)**:
    *   If a module registers its own full SPA (in addition to fragments), the `UIManager` will automatically add a "pop-out" button to that module's primary content container.
    *   Clicking this button will open the module's SPA in a new browser tab. Multiple SPAs per module are supported.

8.  **Theming and Constraints**:
    *   All UI elements, whether from templates or custom, are expected to inherit styling from the `Host`'s main theme to ensure a consistent look and feel. The `UIManager` can enforce certain constraints on dimensions and sizing. Scrollbars are managed on a per-container basis, never on the main SPA body.
